# Bootstrap Module 5 Assignment – Responsive Web Page

Overview
This project was completed as part of Module 5 in my software engineering course. The goal was to create a fully functional, responsive web page using Bootstrap's components, utilities, and grid system.

What I Built
I created a single-page website that includes the following:

 Responsive Navigation Bar
- Built with Bootstrap’s `navbar` component.
- Includes links to Home, About, and Contact.
- Fully collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

 Registration Form
- Designed using Bootstrap’s form components.
- Fields include First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and a Terms & Conditions checkbox.
- Used the Bootstrap grid system to position the first and last name fields side-by-side.
- Applied validation classes to required fields (Email and Password).
- Styled the Submit button using `btn-success`.

Data Table
- Created a responsive table using Bootstrap’s `table`, `table-striped`, and `table-hover` classes.
- Wrapped it in a `table-responsive` div to ensure mobile-friendliness.
- Hard-coded sample user data to simulate form submissions.

Image & Button Utilities
- Inserted a full-width responsive banner image using `img-fluid` inside a `container-fluid`.
- Added a circular profile-style image using `rounded-circle`.
- Included two buttons:
  - One always visible
  - One hidden on small screens using Bootstrap’s responsive utility classes (`d-none`, `d-md-block`)

What I Learned
- How to structure a web page using Bootstrap’s grid and layout utilities.
- How to create interactive and mobile-friendly forms with built-in validation.
- How to use Bootstrap components like navbars, tables, and buttons.
- How to apply responsive utilities like `d-none`, `img-fluid`, and `table-responsive` for better cross-device usability.
- The importance of separating custom CSS from HTML for cleaner code organization.
